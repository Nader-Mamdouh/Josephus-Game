# Josephus-Game
This program implements the Josephus game using a circular queue data structure. The Josephus game is a theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science that involves a circle of people. Starting from a specified position, a counter is used to skip a certain number of people, and the process continues until only one person remains.
## Data Structure used in this project is Circlie_Queue by Linked_List 
There are N people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction.
In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed.
The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed)
until only the last person remains, who is given freedom. 
## Example
Here's an example of how the program works:
Hello In Josephus Game
- Please enter the number of players: 10
- Please enter the increment counter: 3
- The survivor in a circle queue of 10 players with a counter of 3 is player number: 4
